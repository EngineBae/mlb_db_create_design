# Designing and Creating a MLB Database

Working with files sourced from [Retresheet](http://www.retrosheet.org/), a small databse for Major League Baseball games that occured between 1871 to 2016 was created. 

Major steps taken in this project were:
* Import data into SQLite
* Design a normalized database schema
* Create tables for the schema
* Insert data into the schema

Please note that game_log.csv was compressed as it was too large to upload to GitHub.
